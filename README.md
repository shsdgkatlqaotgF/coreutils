## Introduction

The coreutils package contains basic file, shell, and text manipulation utilities. Our Rust implementation aims to enhance performance, reliability, and cross-platform compatibility. By leveraging Rust's memory safety and concurrency features, we provide a robust set of tools that can run seamlessly on various operating systems.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for faster execution.
- **Efficient**: Optimized for performance using Rust's capabilities.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Clear usage guides and examples.
- **Community-Driven**: Open for contributions and suggestions.

## Installation

To install Coreutils, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/shsdgkatlqaotgF/coreutils/releases). After downloading, execute the binary file to start using the utilities.

## Usage

Once installed, you can access Coreutils through your command line. Simply type the command you wish to use, followed by any options or arguments.

For example:

```bash
coreutils ls -l
```

This command will list files in long format.
